# Lab03LinkedList
Third lab in CS 235, using input to create and manage a linked list of node pointers.
"Linked lists are a common data structure in all object-oriented languages and will play a vital role in your activities as a programmer. A forward linked list is a singly linked list of node objects containing a value and a pointer to the next node. Only a head or first node pointer is maintained by the list. All list accesses begin with the head pointer. Forward linked lists are a useful containers for insertion and deletion operations in constant time."
